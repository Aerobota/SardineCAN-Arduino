Sardine CAN - Arduino firmware version 0.3 alpha (Copyright Olaf @ Hacking volvo blog (hackingvolvo.blogspot.com). E-mail: hackingvolvo@gmail.com

This is Sardine CAN, an open source J2534 device, which makes it possible to connect various diagnostic programs (eg. VIDA from Volvo) to your car.

Starting from version 0.3 alpha the Sardine CAN now uses Lawicel CANUSB/CAN232 protocol by default.
(see http://www.canusb.com/documents/canusb_manual.pdf for more information). This makes it possible to use
CanHacker (http://www.mictronics.de/projects/usb-can-bus/)  and other programs using the (almost) identical command set.

Files in this repository are only for Arduino firmware. You also need Windows DLL ( available in github.com/hackingvolvo/SardineCAN-Win32 )
